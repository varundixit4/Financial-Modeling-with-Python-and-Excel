<h1>Financial Modeling with Python and Excel</h1>
<h3>This repository contains the coursework from the financial modeling with python and excel course by Nick DeRobertis</h3> 
<p>The <a href='https://nickderobertis.github.io/fin-model-course/'>course</a> teaches various types and approaches of financial models and how to build them using both excel and python programming</p>
<h3>1. Getting Started with Python and Excel</h3>
<p>In this module, a simple retirement model was made using python and excel. First the inputs were defined such as the salary, the interest rate, the percent of salary that is to be invested, etc. Then the goal was set to find out the number of years to invest so that a person can retire with x amount of money.</p>
<p>In the lab session, the instructions were to use the same model of various parameters, that is multiple interest and savings rates.</p>

<h3>2. The Depth of a Financial Model</h3>
<p>In this module, the simple retirement model was extented and the fixed salary assumption was relaxed. The salary incremented per year which was called as cost of living increment and every x years called as promotion increment. This feature made the model more dynamic and closer to the real world.</p>
<p>In the lab session, the instructions were to relax the assumption of a fixed retirement amount and was calculated based on the expected years after retirement, expenses per year and the rate of interest.</p>
